## Highlight Technical Alignment

**Sample Answer:**
"Having worked with React, Node.js, and MongoDB in my personal projects like InPic AI and ExploreEase, I'm eager to apply these skills in a more complex, enterprise-level environment. TCS Digital's focus on modern technology stacks and digital innovation provides the perfect platform to enhance my expertise while contributing to meaningful business solutions."

## Key Points to Remember:

**Do:**
- Keep it positive about both companies
- Focus on what you want to gain, not what you're escaping
- Connect your skills to TCS Digital's needs
- Show enthusiasm for their specific opportunities

**Don't:**
- Criticize Tech Mahindra
- Mention only salary/benefits as motivation
- Sound desperate or dissatisfied
- Give vague answers

**Pro Tip:** Research TCS Digital's recent projects, technologies, and values beforehand, and weave specific examples into your answer to show genuine interest.

Here are common behavioral interview questions with tailored answers based on your CV:

## 1. Tell me about yourself

**Sample Answer:**
"I'm a Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for full-stack development. Currently, I'm working as an Associate Developer at Tech Mahindra, where I collaborate on responsive web development projects. I've built several personal projects including InPic AI, an image generation platform using React and Node.js, and ExploreEase, a travel booking website. I'm also active in competitive programming with 169+ problems solved on LeetCode and 260+ on GeeksforGeeks. I'm looking to leverage my technical skills in a challenging role that allows me to work on innovative digital solutions."

## 2. What are your strengths?

**Sample Answer:**
"My key strengths are logical thinking and adaptability. For instance, while developing InPic AI, I had to integrate the ClipDrop API and implement a credit-based system - something I hadn't done before. I approached it systematically, researched the documentation, and successfully implemented user authentication with a seamless payment system. My problem-solving skills are evident from my LeetCode achievements, where I've solved 169+ problems by breaking down complex algorithms into manageable steps."

## 3. What are your weaknesses?

**Sample Answer:**
"I sometimes spend too much time perfecting code before moving forward. While working on ExploreEase, I spent considerable time optimizing the React components for performance, which delayed the initial delivery. However, I've learned to balance perfectionism with deadlines by setting time limits for optimization tasks and focusing on MVP delivery first, then iterating for improvements."

## 4. Describe a challenging project you worked on

**Sample Answer:**
"InPic AI was particularly challenging because it required integrating multiple complex systems. I had to implement user authentication, credit management, API integration with ClipDrop, and ensure responsive design across devices. The biggest challenge was handling asynchronous API calls and managing state efficiently in React. I solved this by implementing proper error handling, loading states, and using MongoDB to track user credits and generation history. The project taught me the importance of system design and user experience in full-stack applications."

## 5. How do you handle tight deadlines?

**Sample Answer:**
"During my internship at Tech Mahindra, we had to deliver a responsive website for Haleon within a tight timeline. I prioritized tasks by focusing on core functionality first, then progressive enhancement. I broke down the work into smaller milestones, ensured cross-browser compatibility from the start rather than fixing issues later, and maintained regular communication with the team about progress. This systematic approach helped us deliver on time while maintaining code quality."

## 6. Describe a time you had to learn something new quickly

**Sample Answer:**
"When I started my Advanced React certification, I had to quickly grasp Redux Toolkit for state management - something I hadn't used before. I dedicated 2-3 hours daily to hands-on practice, built small projects to understand the concepts, and applied them to optimize my ExploreEase project. Within two weeks, I was comfortable enough to implement complex state management patterns. This experience taught me the importance of practical application when learning new technologies."

## 7. How do you handle feedback and criticism?

**Sample Answer:**
"I view feedback as a growth opportunity. During my Tech Mahindra internship, my supervisor suggested improvements to my code structure for better maintainability. Instead of being defensive, I asked specific questions about best practices and implemented the changes. I also researched clean code principles and applied them to future tasks. This feedback significantly improved my coding standards and helped me write more maintainable code."

## 8. Why should we hire you?

**Sample Answer:**
"I bring a unique combination of strong technical skills, practical project experience, and problem-solving abilities. My full-stack expertise with React, Node.js, and MongoDB, combined with my industry experience at Tech Mahindra, makes me capable of contributing immediately. My competitive programming background demonstrates my analytical thinking, while projects like InPic AI show my ability to build complete solutions from concept to deployment. I'm also adaptable and eager to learn, which is crucial in the fast-evolving tech industry."

## 9. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

**Sample Answer:**
"In 5 years, I see myself as a senior full-stack developer or technical lead, contributing to architectural decisions and mentoring junior developers. I want to specialize in modern web technologies and cloud platforms while staying updated with emerging trends like AI integration in web applications. My experience with projects like InPic AI has sparked my interest in AI-powered solutions, so I'd love to work on cutting-edge projects that combine traditional web development with AI capabilities."

## 10. Describe a time you failed and what you learned

**Sample Answer:**
"During my early days of competitive programming, I struggled with dynamic programming problems and often got stuck. Initially, I would give up quickly when solutions weren't obvious. I realized I needed to change my approach - I started studying successful solutions, understanding the patterns, and practicing similar problems daily. This failure taught me persistence and the importance of learning from others' approaches. Eventually, I earned a 5-star rating in C++ on HackerRank, which wouldn't have been possible without embracing those initial failures."
