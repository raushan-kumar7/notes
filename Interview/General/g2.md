## Technical Questions

### JavaScript & React

**Q: Difference between let, const, and var?**
**A:** var (function scope, can redeclare), let (block scope, can't redeclare), const (block scope, immutable, must initialize)

**Q: What are React Hooks?**
**A:** Functions to use state and lifecycle in functional components. useState for state, useEffect for side effects, useContext for context.

**Q: Explain Virtual DOM.**
**A:** JavaScript representation of real DOM. React compares virtual DOM trees, finds differences, and updates only changed parts for better performance.

### Backend & Database

**Q: What is Express.js middleware?**
**A:** Functions that execute during request-response cycle with access to req, res, and next. Used for authentication, logging, parsing data.

**Q: MongoDB vs MySQL difference?**
**A:** MongoDB: NoSQL, flexible schema, document-based. MySQL: SQL, structured schema, relational tables with ACID properties.

**Q: REST API principles?**
**A:** Stateless, resource-based URLs, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), JSON responses, client-server separation.

## Project Questions

**Q: Explain InPic AI architecture.**
**A:** React frontend for UI, Node.js/Express backend for API handling, MongoDB for user data, ClipDrop API for image generation. JWT authentication with credit-based system.

**Q: How did you handle user authentication?**
**A:** JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing. Registration → Login → Token generation → Protected routes with middleware validation.

**Q: Challenges in ExploreEase project?**
**A:** Integrating Firebase, managing state across components, optimizing loading times. Solved with proper state management and component optimization.

## Coding Questions

**Q: Find second largest number in array.**
```javascript
function secondLargest(arr) {
    let first = -Infinity, second = -Infinity;
    for(let num of arr) {
        if(num > first) {
            second = first;
            first = num;
        } else if(num > second && num !== first) {
            second = num;
        }
    }
    return second;
}
```

**Q: Check if string is palindrome.**
```javascript
function isPalindrome(str) {
    let clean = str.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '');
    return clean === clean.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

**Q: Reverse a string without built-in functions.**
```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
    let result = '';
    for(let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        result += str[i];
    }
    return result;
}
```
